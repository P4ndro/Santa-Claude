## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Groq API key (optional - can use mock mode)

### Installation

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install client and server dependencies
npm run install:all
```

### Environment Configuration

Create `server/.env`:
```env
# Database
MONGODB_URL=your-mongodb-connection-string

# JWT Secrets
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-access-secret-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key-here

# Server
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3000

# AI Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
USE_MOCK_AI=false

# USE_MOCK_AI=true
```

Create `client/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run both client and server in development mode
npm run dev

# Or run separately:
# Terminal 1 - Server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Client
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## 🎯 Interview Evaluation Philosophy

### Weighted Scoring
- **Technical/coding questions** → Higher weight (2x)
- **Behavioral questions** → Standard weight (1x)

### Report Language
The AI acts as a **coach**, not a hiring authority:
- ✅ "What held your readiness back..."  
- ✅ "Your technical understanding shows strength in..."
- ❌ "You failed..." or "Rejected"

### Primary Blockers
Reports identify specific questions that most negatively affected readiness, with constructive guidance on how to improve.

## 🤖 AI Integration

The project uses **Groq** (Llama 3.3 70B) for fast, free AI inference:

### AI Services

1. **Question Generation** (`server/ai/questionGenerator.js`)
   - Generates tailored questions from job descriptions
   - Practice mode for general interview prep
   - Supports technical, behavioral, and coding questions

2. **Answer Evaluation** (`server/ai/answerEvaluator.js`)
   - Analyzes answer quality, relevance, clarity, and depth
   - Provides detailed feedback per answer
   - Detects strengths and areas for improvement

3. **Report Generation** (`server/ai/reportGenerator.js`)
   - Generates comprehensive interview reports
   - Calculates weighted readiness scores
   - Identifies primary blockers and provides actionable insights

### Mock Mode
If you don't have a Groq API key, set `USE_MOCK_AI=true` in `.env` to use deterministic mock responses for testing.

### Getting a Groq API Key
1. Visit https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to `server/.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY`

## 🏗 Architecture Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Backend owns logic | All business logic lives in the API |
| Frontend is presentational | React only renders UI and calls endpoints |
| Stateless backend | No server-side sessions (except DB) |
| REST API | No GraphQL, no real-time features (yet) |
| Minimal components | Avoid over-splitting React components |
| AI abstraction | Easy to swap AI providers |

---

## 📝 Development Status

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Auth scaffold | ✅ Complete |
| Frontend pages | ✅ Complete |
| API endpoints | ✅ Complete |
| Interview flow | ✅ Complete |
